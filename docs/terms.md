## Assumption Of Risk

You accept and acknowledge each of the following:

The prices of cryptocurrencies and blockchain assets are extremely volatile. As with any asset, the value of NFTs can substantially increase or decrease and there can be a substantial risk that you lose money buying, selling, acquiring or holding NFTs. You should consult your financial advisor, legal or tax professional regarding your specific situation and financial condition and carefully consider whether buying, selling, acquiring or holding NFTs is suitable for you.  

A lack of use or public interest in the creation and development of distributed ecosystems could negatively impact the development of those ecosystems and related applications and could therefore also negatively impact the potential utility of NFTs. 

You are solely responsible for (i) any taxes applicable to any transactions you conduct on our Platform; (ii) any fees associated with your payment method of choice; (iii) any currency conversion fees; and (iv) all associated charges from your internet or mobile network providers. We accept no responsibility for, nor make any representation in respect of, your tax liability. 

There are risks associated with using Internet and Internet-based currency, including, but not limited to, the risk of hardware, software and Internet connections, the risk of malicious software introduction, and the risk that third parties may obtain unauthorized access to information stored within your wallet. You accept and acknowledge that we will not be responsible for any communication failures, disruptions, errors, distortions or delays you may experience when using our Platform, however caused.

All NFTs are stored in your wallet, which is operated by a third-party provider independent from us. The security of the NFTs depends on the security of the third-party wallet provider.

There are risks associated with purchasing items associated with content created by third parties through peer-to-peer transactions, including but not limited to, the risk of purchasing counterfeit items, mislabeled items, items that are vulnerable to metadata decay, items on smart contracts with bugs, and items that may become untransferable. You represent and warrant that you have done sufficient research before making any decisions to sell, obtain, transfer, or otherwise interact with any NFTs or accounts/collections.

Blockchain transactions are irreversible, and Stashh has no ability to reverse any transactions on the blockchain.

The regulatory regime governing blockchain technologies, cryptocurrencies, and tokens is uncertain, and new regulations or policies may materially adversely affect the development of our Platform and the utility of your NFTs.  

**IF YOU HAVE A DISPUTE WITH ONE OR MORE USERS, YOU RELEASE US FROM CLAIMS, DEMANDS, AND DAMAGES OF EVERY KIND AND NATURE, KNOWN AND UNKNOWN, ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH SUCH DISPUTES. IN ENTERING INTO THIS RELEASE YOU EXPRESSLY WAIVE ANY PROTECTIONS (WHETHER STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE) THAT WOULD OTHERWISE LIMIT THE COVERAGE OF THIS RELEASE TO INCLUDE THOSE CLAIMS WHICH YOU MAY KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN YOUR FAVOR AT THE TIME OF AGREEING TO THIS RELEASE.**

## Indemnification

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you will indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Company and its past, present and future employees, partners, contractors, consultants, suppliers, vendors, service providers, agents, representatives, predecessors, successors and assigns (the "Indemnified Parties") from and against all claims, demands, actions, damages, losses, costs and expenses (including attorneysâ€™ fees) that arise from or relate to: (i) your use of the platform or any services, (ii) your responsibilities or obligations under these Terms, (iii) your violation of these Terms, (iv) your violation of any applicable laws or regulations, (v) your violation of any rights of any other person or entity, (vi) your contract with any other user, or (vii) any objectionable, incorrect, or misleading user content posted by you.
