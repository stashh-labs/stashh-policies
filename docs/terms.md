## Connection With A Wallet

In order to buy, sell or transfer NFTs on the Platform, you must connect your account with a third-party wallet. By using your wallet on the Platform, you agree that you are using that wallet under the terms and conditions of the applicable provider of the wallet. Wallets are not operated by, maintained by, or affiliated with Stashh, and Stashh does not have custody or control over the contents of your wallet and has no ability to retrieve or transfer its contents. Stashh accepts no responsibility for, or liability to you, in connection with your use of a wallet and makes no representations or warranties regarding how the Platform will operate with any specific wallet.

Sales price of each NFT is solely decided by the seller. If you are minting and selling an NFT on our Platform, you represent and warrant that you are the owner of the intellectual property rights in the underlying assets or have obtained all relevant rights from the intellectual property rights owners to mint an NFT associated with the underlying asset.

Transaction fees will be automatically deducted from proceeds. We reserve the right to change, modify or increase the transaction fees from time to time and we will use reasonable efforts to provide notice of such changes on our Platform. If you enter into any transaction on the Platform following such modification, you are deemed to have accepted the increased fees regardless of whether you have effectively read or understood said notification. Subject to applicable laws, we will not issue a refund or a credit for transaction fees collected.

To the fullest extent permissible pursuant to applicable law, we, our subsidiaries, affiliates, and licensors make no express warranties and hereby disclaim all implied warranties regarding the Platform and any part of it (including, without limitation, the site, any smart contract, or any external websites), including the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, correctness, accuracy, or reliability.

## Limitation Of Liability

**TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PROVIDED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL THE COMPANY, ITS AFFILIATES, OR THEIR LICENSORS, SERVICE PROVIDERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, OFFICERS, OR DIRECTORS BE LIABLE FOR DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, UNDER ANY LEGAL THEORY, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE, OR INABILITY TO USE, THE PLATFORM, ANY WEBSITES LINKED TO IT, ANY CONTENT ON THE PLATFORM OR SUCH OTHER WEBSITES, INCLUDING ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PERSONAL INJURY, PAIN AND SUFFERING, EMOTIONAL DISTRESS, LOSS OF REVENUE, LOSS OF OPPORTUNITY, LOSS OF REPUTATION, LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF BUSINESS OR ANTICIPATED SAVINGS, LOSS OF USE, LOSS OF GOODWILL, LOSS OF DATA, AND WHETHER CAUSED BY TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), BREACH OF CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF FORESEEABLE.**

**THE FOREGOING DOES NOT AFFECT ANY LIABILITY THAT CANNOT BE EXCLUDED OR LIMITED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW.**

## Assumption Of Risk

You accept and acknowledge each of the following:

The prices of cryptocurrencies and blockchain assets are extremely volatile. As with any asset, the value of NFTs can substantially increase or decrease and there can be a substantial risk that you lose money buying, selling, acquiring or holding NFTs. You should consult your financial advisor, legal or tax professional regarding your specific situation and financial condition and carefully consider whether buying, selling, acquiring or holding NFTs is suitable for you.  

A lack of use or public interest in the creation and development of distributed ecosystems could negatively impact the development of those ecosystems and related applications and could therefore also negatively impact the potential utility of NFTs. 

You are solely responsible for (i) any taxes applicable to any transactions you conduct on our Platform; (ii) any fees associated with your payment method of choice; (iii) any currency conversion fees; and (iv) all associated charges from your internet or mobile network providers. We accept no responsibility for, nor make any representation in respect of, your tax liability. 

There are risks associated with using Internet and Internet-based currency, including, but not limited to, the risk of hardware, software and Internet connections, the risk of malicious software introduction, and the risk that third parties may obtain unauthorized access to information stored within your wallet. You accept and acknowledge that we will not be responsible for any communication failures, disruptions, errors, distortions or delays you may experience when using our Platform, however caused.

All NFTs are stored in your wallet, which is operated by a third-party provider independent from us. The security of the NFTs depends on the security of the third-party wallet provider.

There are risks associated with purchasing items associated with content created by third parties through peer-to-peer transactions, including but not limited to, the risk of purchasing counterfeit items, mislabeled items, items that are vulnerable to metadata decay, items on smart contracts with bugs, and items that may become untransferable. You represent and warrant that you have done sufficient research before making any decisions to sell, obtain, transfer, or otherwise interact with any NFTs or accounts/collections.

Blockchain transactions are irreversible, and Stashh has no ability to reverse any transactions on the blockchain.

The regulatory regime governing blockchain technologies, cryptocurrencies, and tokens is uncertain, and new regulations or policies may materially adversely affect the development of our Platform and the utility of your NFTs.  

**IF YOU HAVE A DISPUTE WITH ONE OR MORE USERS, YOU RELEASE US FROM CLAIMS, DEMANDS, AND DAMAGES OF EVERY KIND AND NATURE, KNOWN AND UNKNOWN, ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH SUCH DISPUTES. IN ENTERING INTO THIS RELEASE YOU EXPRESSLY WAIVE ANY PROTECTIONS (WHETHER STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE) THAT WOULD OTHERWISE LIMIT THE COVERAGE OF THIS RELEASE TO INCLUDE THOSE CLAIMS WHICH YOU MAY KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN YOUR FAVOR AT THE TIME OF AGREEING TO THIS RELEASE.**

## Indemnification

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you will indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Company and its past, present and future employees, partners, contractors, consultants, suppliers, vendors, service providers, agents, representatives, predecessors, successors and assigns (the "Indemnified Parties") from and against all claims, demands, actions, damages, losses, costs and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) that arise from or relate to: (i) your use of the platform or any services, (ii) your responsibilities or obligations under these Terms, (iii) your violation of these Terms, (iv) your violation of any applicable laws or regulations, (v) your violation of any rights of any other person or entity, (vi) your contract with any other user, or (vii) any objectionable, incorrect, or misleading user content posted by you.
