**Introduction**

Our Bug Bounty Programme is designed to encourage security researchers to responsibly disclose security vulnerabilities and bugs found in Stashh.

This document defines the parameters of the bounty program, as well as what you can expect from us and what we expect from you.

1. **Scope**

   1. While researching a bug or vulnerability you must not do any of the following without the express prior written authorisation of the company:

      1. **Violate Privacy**: Access, collect, or disclose personal information about our users, employees, or investors.

      2. **Degrade Service Performance**:  Intentionally degrade the performance or functionality of the service, for example by sending excessive automated requests, overloading systems, or other actions that negatively impact user experience.

      3. **Cause Damage**: Delete, corrupt, or cause damage to data, software, hardware, or infrastructure

      4. **Cause Lasting Harm**: Leave persistent payloads, such as XSS, or similar behind. 

   2. The following areas of the application are explicitly **out of scope**:

      1. **Non-Production Environments**: Staging, testing, or development environments not explicitly mentioned as in-scope.
