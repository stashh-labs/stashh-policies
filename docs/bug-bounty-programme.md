## Introduction
Our Bug Bounty Programme is designed to encourage security researchers to responsibly disclose security vulnerabilities and bugs found in Stashh.

This document defines the parameters of the bounty program as well as what you can expect from us and what we expect from you.

## Scope
While researching a bug or vulnerability you must not do any of the following without the express prior written authorisation of the company:

- **Violate Privacy**: Access, collect, or disclose personal information about our users, employees, or investors.
- **Degrade Service Performance**: Intentionally degrade the performance or functionality of the service, for example, by sending excessive automated requests, overloading systems, or other actions that negatively impact user experience.
- **Cause Damage**: Delete, corrupt, or cause damage to data, software, hardware, or infrastructure.
- **Cause Lasting Harm**: Leave persistent payloads such as XSS or similar behind.

The following areas of the application are explicitly out of scope:

- **Non-Production Environments**: Staging, testing, or development environments not explicitly mentioned as in-scope.
- **Third-Party Services**: Vulnerabilities in third-party websites or services that are integrated with the platform but not controlled by the organisation.
- **Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks**: Any form of Denial of Service attacks.
- **Social Engineering Attacks**: Social engineering attacks such as phishing against the company’s employees, customers, or investors.
- **Physical Attacks**: Vulnerabilities that require direct physical access.
- **Internal Network Vulnerabilities**: Vulnerabilities in the internal network or infrastructure not directly related to the web application.
- **Content Issues**: Issues related to the content displayed on the platform (e.g., inappropriate content posted by other users) unless it leads to a security vulnerability.
- **Spam or Fraud**: General spam or fraud issues that are not directly related to a security vulnerability.
- **Social Media Accounts**: Vulnerabilities in the organisation’s social media accounts.
- **Outdated Browsers and Platforms**: Issues specific to outdated or unsupported browsers, extensions, platforms, or operating systems.
- **Wallets and Extensions**: Vulnerabilities primarily arising from the use of a third-party wallet plugin, tool, or extension.

## Eligibility
You must be at least 18 years old or the age of majority in your country of residence, whichever is older.

Employees, contractors, and directors of the company and their immediate family members are ineligible to receive rewards under this programme.

You must not be a resident of, submit entries from, or require payment to any country under US export sanctions or restrictions.

## Disclosure
Bugs and vulnerabilities should be reported via our Bug Bounty Submission Form at [bugbounty.stashh.io](http://bugbounty.stashh.io).

You must allow a reasonable amount of time for us to address the vulnerability before making any information public. Public disclosure without our prior consent will make any disclosure ineligible for a reward.

## Validity
At least the following information must be included in a vulnerability report for it to be considered valid and complete:

- A thorough explanation of the vulnerability, including the type of vulnerability, affected components, and potential impact.
- A clear description of the steps required to reproduce the vulnerability, including any URLs, parameters, and payloads.
- A proof of concept that demonstrates the vulnerability. This can include screenshots, video recordings, or sample code.
- A description of a realistic attack scenario where the vulnerability could be exploited, including potential damage or data compromise.
- Suggestions or guidance on how the vulnerability could be mitigated or resolved.
- Contact details so the company can reach you if additional information or clarification is needed.

## Rewards
Rewards are granted at the sole discretion of the company. The company reserves the right to decide the severity and impact of a vulnerability and if it has been previously reported.

To qualify for a reward, you must be the first to report the bug or vulnerability and provide a clear description and reproduction steps.

The following guidelines are applied by the company when determining a reward:

| Severity + Impact | Bug            | Vulnerability   |
|------------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Low              | -              | -               |
| Medium           | -              | Up to $500      |
| High             | Up to $50      | Up to $1,000    |
| Critical         | Up to $100     | Up to $2,000    |

Rewards are paid in either US Dollars via bank transfer or USDC on Ethereum.

No financial reward will be paid for submissions that are:

- Out of scope.
- Not reproducible.
- Already known to the company.
- Publicly disclosed without our consent.
- Made in bad faith

Low severity vulnerabilities that are properly disclosed and valid may be eligible for non-monetary rewards, awarded at the sole discretion of the company.

## Acknowledgement
If you have made a valid and complete disclosure, you will receive acknowledgment from the company for your contribution.

You can choose to be publicly recognised on our website and/or in our security advisories. If you prefer to remain anonymous, your privacy will be respected, and your name will not be disclosed.

Attribution will be given only after the reported vulnerability has been resolved. 

All acknowledgments and attributions and their timings are at the discretion of the company.
